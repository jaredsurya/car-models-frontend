# Phase 3 Project Guidelines

## Welcome 
Welcome to the Car Finder vehicle storage database. Here you can add cars you like to the database, and find cars you add displayed amongst other cars.

## Description
I built this app to satisfy the requirements of the Phase 3 project at Flatiron School. I also chose vehicles because I found them to be ubiquitous and simple to work with. This app has 2 forms which the user is prompted to enter values pertinent to a vehicle make (manufacturer) or car model. Upon submitting, the data is saved in a back-end server run by Active Record & Sinatra. After the submission the new entries as well as prior ones are easily viewed on the 'Vehicles' page. A user may interact with the UI, editing or deleting models at will.
